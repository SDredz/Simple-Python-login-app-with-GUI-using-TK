Analysis:

This is a program which includes a graphical user interface, with a login and user registration. 
This program is also built to house the Luhn algorithm to check card vadility and a small word game
that can be played.

Design:

1. The program has a login window
2. The program has a sign up window
3. The program has a main window with clickable links placed there to access other features of the program

Use:

The program will open on a login page. New users are to click the link at the bottom of the window to 
access the sign up window to create an account. 

Once on the sign up window there are boxes with labels
for various info to be inputted by the user. If you do not want to use this window and just want to login
click the link at the bottom of the window. Once the new user's info is inputted, the 'create account' 
button can be clicked to save the new users information.

Once you are on the login page users with existing accounts save onto program are required to type thier
username and password in to the appropriate boxes. Once the is is done the login button can be clicked to
access the rest of the program.

Once the user is on the main hub window, a few menu items are listed:

1. Card Validator:
	This clickable link that brings up the card validator program, in which there is a box to enter
a card number and the button to click to validate that card number. The user will see a message box pop
to inform them wether or not the card number is valid.

2. Game (Madlibs):
	This is a clickable link that brings up the simple console word game, which asks a 
couple of questions to the user and creates a story for the user from the responses from the user

3. Exit:
	This is another clickable link that closes the program once the user clicks it.

User Information:
	At the extreme right on the same window the user information should be displayed. This includes the
users username, phone number and email address.

At the bottom of this window there are some clickable words that logs out the user but does not closes 
the program.
